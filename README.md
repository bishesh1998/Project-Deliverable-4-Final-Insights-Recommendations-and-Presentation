# MSCS 634 – Final Combined Project

## Overview
This repository contains a consolidated Jupyter Notebook combining all three project deliverables. The project demonstrates regression, classification, clustering, and association rule mining applied to healthcare datasets.

## Datasets
1. **Stroke Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)** – Predicting stroke risk using patient demographics and health metrics.  
2. **Diabetes Dataset (sklearn)** – Predicting disease progression via regression modeling.  
3. **Breast Cancer Dataset (sklearn)** – Classification, clustering, and association rules for tumor malignancy detection.

## Notebook
- **Final_Combined_Project.ipynb**: Consolidated code including data cleaning, EDA, modeling, evaluation, and visualizations. All steps are fully commented.

## Key Findings
- **Stroke Prediction:** Age, BMI, and glucose are major risk factors.  
- **Diabetes Regression:** Lasso regression outperforms Linear and Ridge models for test predictions.  
- **Breast Cancer:** k-NN and Random Forest achieve high accuracy; clustering separates malignant vs benign tumors.  
- **Association Rules:** Revealed interpretable patterns linking clinical features to malignancy.
